# In basic RAG, each query is treated independently. The retriever takes your exact question and searches for chunks.

# In history-aware RAG, there's one crucial extra step: "Query Reformulation".
# Before searching, the system looks at the conversation history and rewrites vague or context-dependent questions into clear, standalone questions.

# Why this matters: "Follow-up Questions"
# Humans naturally ask follow-up questions using pronousn, references, and assumptions based on previous converstaion. These questions are often unsearchable on their own.
